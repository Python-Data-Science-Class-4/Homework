1) Rock-Paper-Scissors Take the names of the players and play the stone - paper - scissors game. game 10 hands it will last. At the end of 10 hands, the winner will be determined. The score will be displayed at the end?

2) Course Score Calculation User Name, Surname, Student Number, 4 course names, Visa and Final grades will be required. The sum of 40% of the midterm grade and 60% of the final grade will give the year-end average. If the average is less than 50, "FAILED" on the screen, 50 and above, "PASSED" will be printed on the screen. 

3) Body Mass Index Calculator Parameter showing whether a person's weight is normal for their height. It is called Body Mass Index. In short, a person's weight is equal to a person's height. If we divide it by its square, the body mass index is obtained. User's weight and height If the result by taking the length is below 25, NORMAL, if it is between 25-30 OVER WEIGHT, OBSE if 30-40, EXTREMELY OBSE if 40 and over print a warning.

4) Ask for a number input from the user.
Create a loop that finds prime numbers up to this number. Prime numbers are positive integers that are only divisible  by 1 and itself.
Print the found prime numbers on the screen.
Ask the user if they want to enter another number. If user want, keep finding prime numbers for a new number by repeating the loop.
