1. Review the PowerPoint Presentation: You need to review the PowerPoint presentation, which contains the topics discussed in class. Make sure you have an understanding of each fundamental topic.

2. Examine the Shared Notebook: Take a look at the notebook below, which includes the shared code and more. It’s essential to understand its contents. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the group chat so that everyone can benefit.

3. Download the Insurance Dataset: Download the insurance dataset from the link provided below. Within the scope of the course, you’ll need to apply the following linear regression models: 
    o Simple Linear Regression: Choose a single independent variable (column) with the highest correlation.
    o Multiple Linear Regression
    o Principal Component Regression (PCR)
    o Partial Least Squares (PLS)
    o Ridge Regression
    o Lasso Regression
    o Elasticnet Regression

Note 1: Examples of how to use these models are available in the notebook I shared with you.

Note 2: For each model, find the R2 score and RMSE values. Present the R2 scores in a bar graph and the RMSE values in a separate bar graph as a summary.

Note 3: Once you’ve prepared the notebook, upload it to GitHub so that I can review it from there.

Note 4: There’s no need to perform preprocessing on the dataset. Our goal is to learn about model usage and make comparisons.
