1. Review the PowerPoint Presentation: You need to review the PowerPoint presentation, which contains the topics discussed in class. Make sure you have an understanding of each fundamental topic.

2. Examine the Shared Notebook: Take a look at the notebook, which includes the shared code and more. It’s essential to understand its contents. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the group chat so that everyone can benefit.

3. Download the Insurance Dataset: Download the insurance dataset from the link provided below. Within the scope of the course, you’ll need to apply the following non-linear regression models:

        o KNN 
        o SVR (Destek Vektör Regresyonu) 
        o MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron) 
        o CART(Decission Tree) 
        o Bagged Trees Regresyon 
        o Random Forests 
        o Gradient Boosting Machines 
        o XGBoost 
        o Light GBM 
        o CatBoost

Note 1: Examples of how to use these models are available in the notebook I shared with you.

Note 2: For each model, find the R2 score and RMSE values. Present the R2 scores in a bar graph and the RMSE values in a separate bar graph as a summary. 

Note 3: Once you’ve prepared the notebook, upload it to GitHub so that I can review it from there. 

Note 4: There’s no need to perform preprocessing on the dataset. Our goal is to learn about model usage and make comparisons. (You need to use one hot encoding on categorical data to apply the non-linear models)
