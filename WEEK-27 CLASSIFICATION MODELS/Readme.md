Note 1: Examples of how to use these models are available in the notebook I shared with you.

Note 2: For each model, find the accuracy score, precission, recall and f1 score. Present the scores in a bar graph to compare models outcomes.

Note 3: Once you’ve prepared the notebook, upload it to GitHub so that I can review it from there.

Note 4: You need to perform preprocessing on the dataset. Use one-hot encoding or other necessary technics. If you need scaling or transform for a specific column, please perform it.
