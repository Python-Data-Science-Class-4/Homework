# WEEK-4 MODULES, PACKAGES AND EXCEPTION HANDLING HOMEWORK


'''1 - Random Password Generator

As a user, I want to use a program which can generate random password and print it. So that I can generate my password for any application.


## Acceptance Criteria:

- Password length must between 10 and 20 characters long. Get this information from the user.
- It must contain at least 2 upper case letter, 2 digits and 2 special symbols (puncuations).
- You must mix all the characters.
- The output must be shown also the number of the passwords characters numbers.
- You must write comment lines for explaining the functions of the code bloks.
- You must import some required modules or packages. (use import random, string)'''




## 2 - Calculator

'''As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate basic mathematical operations with using functions. So that I can add, subtract, multiply or divide my inputs. 
The code must always works until the user want to exit. The code should never crash: while receiving information from the user, calculating, etc.


## Acceptance Criteria:

-  The calculator must support the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division operations. 
-  Define four modules in four different files for each of them, with two float numbers as parameters. 
-  And you must import these modules into your main file. To calculate the result, use math.ceil() and get the next integer value greater than the result. 
-  Create a menu using the print command with the respective options and take an input choice from the user. 
-  Use if/elif statements for cases and call the appropriate functions. 
-  Use try/except blocks in main file and modules to prevent crashes. 
-  Ask user if it wants to calculate again. To implement this, take the input from user y(yes) or n(no). 
-  (use import sys, ceil and other calculation functions from the math module)
